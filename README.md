# Foosball Angle Calculator

## Overview

This project was inspired by the dynamics of playing foosball, particularly the challenging angles one can achieve with precise ball positioning and strategic play. The goal of this project is to explore how tight these angles can become based on the ball's position and the defensive setup.

Using Python with NumPy for matrix operations, Matplotlib for visualization, and trigonometry for angle calculations, this program allows users to position the ball and defensive pieces anywhere on the foosball table. It then calculates and visualizes the possible shooting angles, providing insights into the range of shot possibilities.

## Features

- **Flexible Positioning**: Users can position the ball and defensive pieces anywhere on the foosball table.
- **Angle Calculation**: The program calculates the possible shooting angles based on the ball's position and defensive setup.
- **Visualization**: Visualizes the foosball table with the calculated shooting angles overlaid for easy interpretation.

## Usage

1. **Installation**: Make sure you have Python installed on your system. Install the required dependencies using pip:

   ```bash
   pip install numpy matplotlib

2. **Running the Program**: Execute the main Python script to run the foosball angle calculator:

      ```bash
   python foosball_angle_calculator.py

3. **Using the Program**: Adjust the various sliders to position the ball and foosball pieces. Press the **Find Angles** button and the program will calculate and display the shooting angles on the plotted foosball table.

## Dependencies

- Python 3.x
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
